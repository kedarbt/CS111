*I AM RETAKING THIS CLASS, MUCH OF THE CODE IS THE SAME AS I TURNED IN LAST TIME. MINOR MODIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE*

This file contains a basic description of the purpose and contents of each file contained in my submission.

lab1a.c:

This file contains my implentation of non-canonical output to the terminal as well as using the shell with the --shell command. The function readwrite() handles all the read and write operations passed to the terminal through keyboard input. When the shell exits, the status is output using WEXITSTATUS and WTERMSIG.
Makefile:
	default: builds an executable using the -g -Wall and -Wextra.
	clean: This removes the executable and tarball, leaving just the README		     , the source file, and the makefile.
	dist: This creates a tarball out of the source code, the makefile, and 		     the README.
